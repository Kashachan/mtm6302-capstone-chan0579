Design explaination:

For this mockup, I used Adobe Illustrator to design the interface, creating versions for desktop, laptop, and mobile screens. The dimensions are as follows: 

Desktop: 1440x1024
Tablet: 1024x768
Mobile: 375x700

I designed the Pokedex logo and chose light blue for the heading background. This color was selected to create a calming and clear atmosphere, which fits with the idea of exploring and discovering new things,much as in the world of Pokemon.

The backgrounds include trees, sky, and ocean, creating a natural, free-spirited vibe. I chose these because, like other creatures, Pokemon belong in the wild. The outdoors is where players are intended to capture them, so it made obvious to incorporate these features to heighten the sense of adventure.

For the typography, sans serif fonts were used to create a clean, user-friendly interface with excellent readability. To emphasize headings, DIN Alternate Bold was selected for its strong, black, bold style, establishing a clear visual hierarchy.

Finally, the buttons were designed in brilliant colours to catch players' attention, engage them, and reflect the fun, interactive nature of the game. This aligns with the branding's playful and exciting spirit.


Prototype Report:

Steps Taken:
1. Reviewed the project requirements.
2. Used HTML to structure the content, including the Pokémon gallery and navigation and CSS for styling the page.
3. Added a button to load more Pokémon.
4. Ensured the web application was responsive across different devices using Bootstrap.
5. Tested the prototype across multiple devices.

Resources Used:
1. Pokémon API: https://pokeapi.co/ to fetch Pokémon data.
2. Bootstrap 5: https://getbootstrap.com/ for responsive layout.
3. CSS Flexbox: For creating a flexible grid. 
4. JavaScript:  For handling Pokémon data fetching, dynamic UI updates such as catching and releasing Pokémon.

Challenges Faced:

The biggest challenge was handling asynchronous data fetching from the Pokémon API and ensuring the Pokémon gallery loaded correctly. 

Another challenge was ensuring the modal worked well on various screen sizes was tricky. I had to adjust the modal’s size and position using media queries for smaller screens to prevent it from overflowing.
